# G01 capability probes

The first executable slice probes **page counts/dimensions, Info metadata,
embedded-file bytes and text** using independently authored populated/empty
controls and a non-PDF rejection control. All six baseline columns are retained.
G01 remains open: these ten cases do not establish family or product parity.
The companion [render manifest](rendering.json) retains six original pixel
oracles: blank and rectangle controls, fractional geometry, JPX grayscale and straight/
premultiplied JPX alpha. Seven legacy font controls extend the manifest to
13 cases and 91 cells, using the public Pagura CLI and all six render adapters. The ledger retains six competitor columns;
Pagura is an additional measured subject, never a replacement baseline.

| Baseline | Public adapter paths | Explicit adapter gaps | Hosted execution |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDFium | Pages, metadata, attachments, text | Optional V8/XFA builds not covered | Ubuntu, locked pypdfium2 wheel |
| MuPDF | Pages, metadata, attachments, text | Optional providers not covered | Ubuntu, locked PyMuPDF wheel |
| pdf.js | Pages, metadata, attachments, text | Browser configuration not covered | Ubuntu, locked Node legacy build; eval disabled |
| Poppler | Pages, metadata, attachments, text | Other bindings/configurations not covered | Ubuntu, OS GLib/GI packages |
| hayro | Pages, ASCII Info metadata | Attachment and text reconstruction not implemented in this adapter | Ubuntu, locked standalone Rust workspace |
| CoreGraphics | Pages, Info metadata, EmbeddedFiles via public object/stream APIs | Text reconstruction not implemented in this adapter | macOS system framework; no PDFKit |

A missing adapter path is `adapter-unavailable`, not a claim that an engine
cannot perform the work. Each platform report also retains the other platform's
columns as `not-run`. The combined report must cover every engine exactly once.
Neither outcome becomes an unsupported feature or a release exemption.

The [manifest](document-services.json) owns exact expectations. The fixture builder
in [capability_probes.py](../../tools/capability_probes.py) writes small, synthetic
classic-xref PDFs without using Pagura or a competitor writer. Expectations are
not generated from measured output or majority agreement. Text normalization
only replaces CRLF with LF and trims leading/trailing LF; whitespace and character
differences otherwise fail. Attachment names and SHA-256 payload hashes must match.
The current metadata fixtures are ASCII; they do not exercise PDFDocEncoding,
UTF-16, XMP or malformed strings. Page fixtures do not yet cover rotation/UserUnit.

The adapters use documented public APIs:
[pypdfium2](https://pypdfium2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python_api.html),
[PyMuPDF document](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/document.html) and
[page](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/page.html),
[pdf.js PDFDocumentProxy](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/api/draft/module-pdfjsLib-PDFDocumentProxy.html),
[Poppler GLib document](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/api/glib/PopplerDocument.html) and
[attachment](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/api/glib/PopplerAttachment.html),
[hayro 0.8.0 page](https://docs.rs/hayro-syntax/0.8.0/hayro_syntax/page/struct.Page.html) and
[metadata](https://docs.rs/hayro-syntax/0.8.0/hayro_syntax/metadata/struct.Metadata.html),
and [CoreGraphics CGPDFDocument](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgpdfdocument).
No competitor implementation source was consulted for these adapters.

## Execution and evidence

The hosted [capability workflow](../../.github/workflows/capabilities.yml) runs
source checks and harness controls on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows, then actual
engine probes on Ubuntu and macOS. Competitor packages/builds stay outside the
product checkout. No product dependencies change. While ADR 0031 reserves the
local machine, run engines/tests only in hosted CI.

```sh
# Source-only validation, without imports or invocation of external engines:
python tools/capability_probes.py check
python tools/capability_render.py check
# Hosted Ubuntu, after installing the OS Poppler GLib/GI packages:
python tools/competitors.py setup --engines pdfium,mupdf,pdfjs,hayro
python tools/capability_probes.py run --engines pdfium,mupdf,pdfjs,poppler,hayro --output /tmp/linux.json
cargo build --release --locked --offline --bin pagura
python tools/capability_render.py run --engines pdfium,mupdf,pdfjs,poppler,hayro,pagura --output /tmp/render-linux.json
# Hosted macOS:
python tools/competitors.py setup --engines quartz
python tools/capability_probes.py run --engines quartz --output /tmp/mac.json
python tools/capability_render.py run --engines quartz --output /tmp/render-mac.json
# Join reports from one workflow run/revision (no engine execution):
python tools/capability_probes.py combine /tmp/linux.json /tmp/mac.json --output /tmp/combined.json
python tools/capability_render.py combine /tmp/render-linux.json /tmp/render-mac.json --output /tmp/render-combined.json
```

Each platform publishes `capability-document-services-<os>`, even when a probe
fails. After successful platform jobs, `capability-document-services` combines
all 60 cells, requiring disjoint engine selections and identical revision,
workflow-run, source and fixture hashes. Reports record environment, adapter,
manifest, lock and native binary identities. Python/pdf.js/hayro dependencies
are pinned; Poppler and CoreGraphics use the actual recorded OS versions, not
an asserted lock pin. Workspace/cache paths become placeholders. Native
diagnostics retain byte counts and hashes rather than raw logs.

`capability-rendering-<os>` and `capability-rendering` retain the pixel observations
separately. Joining requires all six baselines plus Pagura. The CLI version and
actual Pagura binary hash are recorded; the hosted workflow builds default
features from its checkout using the pinned toolchain. Outside that workflow,
a pre-existing binary has no asserted source revision. The exact PDF/oracle bytes and normalized RGB identities are hashed.
P6/PAM/RGBA adapter output is normalized to RGB over white without resizing,
alignment or inferred tolerance. Every pixel must meet the fixture's existing
per-channel bound at the recorded dimensions. There is no majority-vote oracle.
Fresh output, matching dimensions and attested comparisons are required for a
pass; a successful process exit or leftover image cannot pass. Nonzero renderer
exits remain unclassified adapter failures until investigated, never presumed
backend rejections or unsupported features. These probes do not measure or
compare the render adapters' timing output. Embedded ICC/sYCC and Indexed JPX
alpha from the separate R02 implementation PR will be added after consolidation.
The `--images` option retains actual/oracle PPM pairs for these project-owned
synthetic fixtures; hosted `capability-render-images-<os>` artifacts allow visual
adjudication without committing measured output. A pixel disagreement can reflect
colour, sampling or antialiasing policy and is not by itself an established engine
defect. No tolerance is relaxed to turn an observation into a pass.

`pass` requires the independent expectation, or an engine rejection for the
invalid-input control. A wrong result is `incorrect`; a rejection of valid input
is `rejected`. `unsupported` requires a named explicit backend refusal; the
adapters do not invent one from exceptions. Timeout, adapter errors, absent
adapter paths and unavailable engine installations remain distinct outcomes.
CI requires a completed observation on each implemented adapter path: `pass`,
`incorrect`, a valid-input rejection or a named explicit unsupported result.
Competitor differences are evidence, so they stay visible without failing the
measuring tool. Broken/unavailable adapters, engine installations and timeouts
fail the workflow. The seven explicitly unimplemented case/engine cells stay
visible too. CI success therefore cannot establish engine correctness or release
readiness. The added Pagura column must pass every selected independent oracle
for its job to succeed; a measured Pagura disagreement remains in the report
and fails this check.

Harness controls check wrong values, boolean/numeric confusion, rejection
evidence, invalid envelopes, missing/duplicate cells, unattested passes, malformed
output, timeouts and missing executables. Report joining also rejects mixed
revisions, fixtures, source hashes or workflow runs and incomplete/overlapping
engine coverage. These controls use stubs, not competitor libraries.
Pixel controls additionally cover wrong/corrupt output, stale files, dimension
and hash mismatches, tolerance drift and process crashes.

## Attachment API controls

The original and companion attachment cases exercise EF/F-only and EF/F+UF
stream dictionaries with F/UF filenames (ISO 32000-2 7.7.4 Table 32 and 7.11.3
Table 43). Both retain the same independently authored payload expectation.
The pinned pdf.js 6.4 API returns a Map of descriptors and retrieves uncached
bytes through `getAttachmentContent(id)`. The adapter checks those shapes;
offline Node controls cover lazy bytes, already available bytes, empty Maps,
null results and unexpected return types. Treating the Map as an object would
incorrectly discard attachments; the controls prevent that adapter regression.
The initial expanded reports predate this fix and do not establish a pdf.js
defect. Only reports with the corrected adapter/source hashes are usable for
this comparison. Raw reports remain in CI artifacts, outside Git.

## Initial rendering observations

[Hosted run 40256476588](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40256476588)
measured the six controls against all six baselines at merge revision
`dfccec8472a614ef49a2e8a0264e37cdfb7c0a69`: 20 pixel-oracle passes and 16
incorrect observations. Both empty/integer-rectangle controls passed everywhere.
pdf.js met all six bounds; the other disagreements involve fractional coverage,
grayscale resampling or embedded alpha. This run predates the Pagura column.
The JPX grayscale control was mislabeled `jpx.rgb` in those reports; its fixture
and oracle bytes have not changed.

The actual normalized image hashes repeat across the two hosted runs
40256137477 and 40256476588. Sample inspection is consistent with resampling differences in
the grayscale/straight-alpha images, opaque partial-alpha samples in the hayro/PDFium
premultiplied-alpha output, and non-neutral colour in Poppler's red-alpha input.
These observations still need matched uncompressed controls and explicit
sampling/configuration adjudication; they do not establish competitor defects.
No oracle or tolerance was changed after measurement. Reproduce from the
reports' exact source, native-artifact and fixture hashes, not the current branch.

## Next G01 increments

- Extend Pagura observations beyond rendering through its actual public surfaces,
  including explicit missing typed metadata/attachment APIs, before claiming
  comparative parity.
- Resolve the remaining hayro/CoreGraphics adapter gaps against their public API
  contracts; do not implement a substitute engine and attribute its capabilities
  to the baseline.
- Probe tag subvariants, optional XFA/V8 builds, forms/events, annotation/layer
  state, save/reopen, redaction and signatures, each with independent controls.
- Add explicit resource-limit controls and browser/configuration coverage, and
  bind current results to each scoped capability subvariant. A successful basic
  fixture never closes an entire [capability family](../../docs/CAPABILITIES.md)
  or a release gate.

## Legacy post-name inputs

The font group adds seven independent rendering controls to the six original
controls: three post 2.5 subjects, three matched post 2 cases, and an ordinary
rectangle with the same analytically defined glyph area. Outlines, advances and
cmap bytes match within each font pair. The routes are direct Unicode cmap,
name fallback after an unmapped cmap code, and an explicit PDF Differences name.
The original synthetic rectangle supplies every pixel expectation.

[Hosted diagnostic run 40381321934](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40381321934)
at `cce9569c5e53ead8d42fcfc9c045931acfa633f6` used a reduced nine-case manifest.
MuPDF passed all nine cases. Pagura passed all six controls; its three subject
failures remain `adapter-error` in that older harness, which did not retain a
named refusal. The source reader rejects the post 2.5 version. PDF.js and Poppler
passed the direct subject and its pair, but missed the two name-based subjects
while passing their post 2 controls. PDFium and CoreGraphics missed paired font
controls; hayro missed the name-based controls. Those cells do not establish
format-specific gaps. No tolerance was relaxed or measured artwork copied.

Linux report SHA-256:
`73beefea8ecaaafd6cb908477975d46c9cf795ed0dd3dab6130f533a375aacfb`.
macOS report SHA-256:
`76dee296a926897956bc6973451ee1907820a13aedf103d50b0f27930e58b43f`.
The integrated 13-case manifest preserves the original six controls. At `6ac4b1d27caa9bf2690f1105764b027059932998`,
[hosted run 40385518384](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40385518384)
passes all 13 Pagura cases. Its combined report contains 91 cells; SHA-256
`a61e91bceb3d01c4bb2aab579788179647b942e653f3b237044adedc3b5dba66`.
The retained diagnostic failures describe the previous reader. The same integrated
head passes [full Ubuntu, macOS and Windows checks](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40385513689).
Neither result establishes the entire font family or validates later changes.

The preceding vertical-substitution checkpoint `a0533c2d6` passed
[full hosted Ubuntu, macOS and Windows checks](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40380082421).
That validates its native synthetic maps, PDF metrics/extraction and bundled
collection controls at that revision; it does not establish competitor-family
parity or validate the later base and post-name combination.

## Legacy post 4 admission

The integrated set now retains all 13 prior controls and adds four exact
post 4/post 3 direct-cmap subjects/controls from diagnostic `791f19b6c`. The
[Linux diagnostic](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40387744536)
shows MuPDF, PDF.js and Poppler passing both subjects and all controls; Pagura
passes its five controls but refuses both subjects. PDFium misses the paired
font controls; those cells are not format-specific evidence. Report SHA-256:
`5ca216fa6965417fe0332667edcb9ada956e7a949a135be70fd17c204d02c8f7`.

A [separate six-name probe](https://github.com/jonasgrosch/pagura/actions/runs/40390798842)
at `dd0a67d3c` compares hexadecimal spellings with literal post 2 name controls.
MuPDF, PDF.js, Poppler and hayro miss all six post 4 names while accepting every
paired name control. The primary text does not fix case or padding; these are
observations, not six normative obligations. Report SHA-256:
`63825a1f18748072b40ba9a13f4778bdaeaec173f6de38aab23b01cd98c9a77d`.

The existing post reader now admits the complete code array for cmap use, with
no synthesized printer names, copied metadata or alternate selector. Exact
count, truncation and work-budget controls are authored. Integrated hosted
validation of the new 17-case manifest is pending; no family support is claimed.
